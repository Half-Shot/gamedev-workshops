Introduction to Game Programming and Development with C#
=================
A workshop for Chelmsford Makerspace run by Sam and Will. This workshop will give people an overview of the C# programming
language, then teach them how to apply it in a gamedev sort of way.

Things to note
----
* People will have to bring their own computers, if possible
* If there's not enough computers to go around, then makerspace people could supply their own machines?
* Or we could have some kind of rota where everyone gets an equal amount of time on the computers

Software
----
* Visual C# Studio 2010 (2012 works too, but 2010 is preferred)

Prerequisites
----
* Base project produced by Sam and Will in which the user can mess around in

General Format
----
A screenshot of the code will be up on the screen, Sam or Will will say "Right, time to type this in"
(or something to that effect), then once everyone has typed it in we'll explain what they have just done.

Place emphasis on *NOT* splitting code up into multiple slides, where possible. This is to
make it as non confusing as possible.

How it's gonna go down
----
*Remember to emphasize the fact that questions can be asked at ANY point.*

      * Remember, our aim here is to teach them, not to blow their minds
* Question time - Sam and Will will answer any questions anyone has
* Set them up on the base project, and tell them to go crazy
   * Tell them that if their project won't build, to call one of us over and we'll help
   * Use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method">Socratic Method</a> to teach them, wherever possible.
   * Allocate time for everyone to show their creations at the end
